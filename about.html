<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Sachin Pathak and welcome to my page. I'm a computer science major who has an interest in web development. At this moment, I'm learning html and I'm planning on
  expanding my horizons in other front end languages like CSS and JavaScript. I'm also proficient in back end languages like Java and Python.
</p>

<p>Aside from programming, I enjoy playing videogames (mostly Nintendo), going to the gym, and watching anime.</p>
